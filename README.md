Hello everyone , I have completed three minor tasks during my virtual internship of java programming at codsoft.

The first task is to create the GRADE CALCULATOR which calculates the average percentage and grade.

Second task is creating the NUMBER GAME where a random number is generated and user have to guess the generated number.

The last task is to create the ATM INTERFACE which have the function to withdraw, deposite, and see available balance.

This internship helped me to clear my concepts and work on my java skills.
